> As I dive into my master's in pedagogy, I want to share insights about how teaching and technology intersect in the classroom and beyond. Drawing from my own experiences in tech education, letâ€™s explore the evolving role of educators in fostering critical thinking and curiosity.


# Reflections on Teaching and Tech II

Hello, everyone! ðŸ‘‹

This weekâ€™s reflections have been deeply shaped by insights from *Viral Justice* by **Ruha Benjamin** and her co-authored piece *Disrupting the Gospel of Tech Solutionism to Build Tech Justice* with **Greta Byrum**. Both works challenge us to rethink how technology and education intersect with justice. As educators, these ideas encourage us to create learning environments that not only foster critical thinking but also empower students to question the systems around them and envision more equitable futures.

## Dismantling the "Great Equalizer" Myth

In *Viral Justice*, Benjamin (2022) challenges the long-held notion of education as the **"great equalizer,"** arguing that, far from equalizing opportunities, traditional education systems often deepen inequalities. This critique aligns with my experiences in tech education, where access to learning is not distributed equally. Many students, especially those from marginalized backgrounds, face structural barriers that go beyond the classroom. These can include lack of access to technology, inadequate resources, or simply not having the familial or institutional support to succeed in a traditional learning environment.

In the tech world, it's easy to assume that teaching coding or data analysis is inherently neutral, but we must remember that **access is power**. For some students, simply being in the classroom is a victory, and the real challenge is overcoming the systemic barriers that exist long before they start learning technical skills. As Benjamin reminds us, education can either reinforce these barriers or become a space for dismantling them.

## Reimagining Education Beyond the Classroom

In *Disrupting the Gospel of Tech Solutionism*, Benjamin and Byrum (2022) critique the idea that technology alone can solve complex social problems. They argue that **tech solutionism**â€”the belief that technology is the fix for every issueâ€”often fails to consider the underlying structural injustices in society. Instead, we need to center the voices of those most impacted by technology's harms and biases. This resonates deeply with my own experiences working with programs like Laboratoria, where women in Latin America are learning to code and analyze data in nontraditional settings. These students are transforming their futures not because they follow a set curriculum, but because they engage with learning that directly impacts their lives and communities.

In my teaching practice, Iâ€™ve introduced **collaborative learning circles** where students take turns leading discussions on how the technologies they are learning impact their communities. This allows them to approach the subject matter from their own perspectives and encourages peer-to-peer learning. The results have been incredible; students not only develop their technical skills but also begin to see the broader societal implications of their work. This has helped them connect with the material on a deeper level and foster a sense of agency in their learning process.

## Building Justice-Oriented Classrooms

Benjaminâ€™s emphasis on **justice-oriented education** challenges educators to think beyond conventional methods and towards creating learning environments that foster empowerment. Applying her ideas in the classroom means moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach to education and focusing instead on the unique challenges and strengths each student brings.

Through the integration of technology and community-focused projects, my goal has been to create spaces where students can learn from each other and see the real-world impact of their education. This shift from content delivery to community-oriented projects allows students to feel more connected to their learning and helps foster the critical thinking skills necessary to challenge existing social structures.

Benjamin and Byrumâ€™s work reminds us that the goal of education should not be to create compliant learners but to empower students to think critically, challenge systems of oppression, and become agents of change in their communities.

## Recommendations for Further Reading

For anyone interested in exploring the intersection of education, technology, and social justice, I highly recommend **Ruha Benjaminâ€™s *Viral Justice*** and **Byrum & Benjaminâ€™s *Disrupting the Gospel of Tech Solutionism to Build Tech Justice***. These readings provide a forward-thinking approach to how education and technology can dismantle inequalities and create a more just world. They challenge us, as educators, to rethink how we approach teaching and to consider the broader implications of our work in the classroom.
