# Mastering Core Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues

Core data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues form the foundation of problem-solving in programming. Understanding these structures is crucial for technical interviews and real-world applications. In this post, we'll explore their concepts, use cases, and Python implementations.

---

## **1. Arrays**

### **What is an Array?**
An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. It provides fast access to elements using indices.

### **Key Operations**
- **Access**: O(1)
- **Search**: O(n)
- **Insertion/Deletion**: O(n) due to element shifting.

### **Use Cases**
- Quick lookup by index.
- Iterating over data collections.
- Storing fixed-size collections.

### **Python Example: Find Maximum in an Array**
```python
def find_max(arr):
    max_val = arr[0]
    for num in arr:
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
    return max_val

# Test
array = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
print("Maximum:", find_max(array))  # Output: Maximum: 9
```

## **2. Linked Lists**

### **What is a Linked List?**
A linked list is a sequence of nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. It allows dynamic memory allocation.

### **Key Operations**
- **Access**: O(n) (traversal required).
- **Insertion/Deletion**: O(1) if performed at the head or a known position.

### **Use Cases**
- Dynamic data storage.
- Frequent insertions and deletions.

### **Python Example: Append and Print a Linked List**
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        current = self.head
        while current.next:
            current = current.next
        current.next = new_node

    def print_list(self):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            print(current.data, end=" -> ")
            current = current.next
        print("None")

# Test
ll = LinkedList()
ll.append(1)
ll.append(2)
ll.append(3)
ll.print_list()  # Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None
```

## **3. Stacks**

### **What is a Stack?**
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. Elements are added and removed only from the top.

### **Key Operations**
- **Push**: O(1)
- **Pop**: O(1)
- **Peek**: O(1)

### **Use Cases**
- Undo functionality.
- Expression evaluation (e.g., postfix evaluation).
- Recursive problem-solving.

### **Python Example: Implementing a Stack**
```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    def push(self, data):
        self.stack.append(data)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.stack.pop()
        return "Stack is empty"

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.stack[-1]
        return "Stack is empty"

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.stack) == 0

# Test
stack = Stack()
stack.push(10)
stack.push(20)
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 20
print(stack.peek())  # Output: 10
```

## **4. Queues**

### **What is a Queue?**
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

### **Key Operations**
- **Enqueue**: O(1)
- **Dequeue**: O(1)

### **Use Cases**
- Task scheduling.
- Breadth-first search (BFS) in graphs.

### **Python Example: Implementing a Queue**
```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def enqueue(self, data):
        self.queue.append(data)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.queue.pop(0)
        return "Queue is empty"

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.queue) == 0

# Test
queue = Queue()
queue.enqueue(5)
queue.enqueue(15)
print(queue.dequeue())  # Output: 5
print(queue.dequeue())  # Output: 15
```

## **Comparison Table**

| **Data Structure** | **Access** | **Insertion/Deletion** | **Key Use Cases**                         |
|---------------------|------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Array**           | O(1)       | O(n)                  | Random access, fixed-size collections     |
| **Linked List**     | O(n)       | O(1)                  | Dynamic storage, frequent insert/delete   |
| **Stack**           | O(n)       | O(1)                  | Undo operations, recursion                |
| **Queue**           | O(n)       | O(1)                  | Task scheduling, BFS traversal            |
