# Cluster Analysis (Clustering)

**Cluster analysis** is a structural technique used in statistics and data science to group similar individuals or objects, allowing large amounts of information to be efficiently summarized. This method is widely used in various disciplines such as biology, marketing, and data science, where the classification of elements into homogeneous groups facilitates the understanding and analysis of complex data.

## What is Cluster Analysis?

Cluster analysis groups elements based on their similarity or dissimilarity, ensuring that members within a group are as similar to each other as possible, and as different as possible from members of other groups. It is a powerful tool when identifying patterns or segments within a dataset without relying on predefined labels, making it an unsupervised technique.

### Origins in Biology

Cluster analysis has its roots in biology, where it was used to classify species into homogeneous groups. Sokal and Sneath (1963) were pioneers in highlighting classification as a fundamental process in science, allowing phenomena to be organized for better understanding.

## Types of Data and Scales in Cluster Analysis

The variables used in cluster analysis must be measured on a similar scale. Data can be measured on interval, ratio scales, or nominal variables converted to dummy variables. Some of the most common scales include:

- **Dichotomous data** (dummy)
- **Frequency data**
- **Interval scale**
- **Ratio scale**

## Steps in Cluster Analysis

1. **Select Variables**: Identify the variables that will define the groups.
2. **Measure Proximity**: Proximity between elements can be expressed in terms of similarity or dissimilarity, depending on the data characteristics.
3. **Choose a Method**: There are several methods for clustering, including hierarchical and non-hierarchical methods.
4. **Group the Elements**: Use the selected techniques to form clusters.

## Clustering Methods

### Hierarchical Clustering

There are two main variants of hierarchical clustering:

- **Agglomerative Method**: Starts by assuming each object is an independent group and progressively merges them until only one cluster remains.
- **Divisive Method**: Starts with a single cluster containing all objects and divides them until each object forms its own group.

#### Linkage Criteria

The linkage criterion evaluates how similar groups are when merged:

- **Single Linkage**: Based on the minimum distance between two points of each cluster.
- **Complete Linkage**: Considers the maximum distance between points in the clusters.
- **Average Linkage**: Averages the distances between points in the clusters.

### Non-Hierarchical Clustering

Non-hierarchical methods, such as **k-means**, do not require a specific order in the formation of groups and are more efficient when dealing with a large number of variables or elements. In the k-means method, the number of groups must be specified beforehand. Elements are grouped by calculating the averages of their characteristics and reassigning them to the nearest cluster.

## Considerations for Proximity Measures

**Proximity** between two objects is crucial in determining whether they should be grouped together. The smaller the value of a dissimilarity measure, the more similar two objects are. Conversely, higher values in a similarity measure indicate greater resemblance.

It is important to select a proximity measure that fits the type of data being used. Depending on the case, you may choose to measure either similarity or dissimilarity between objects.

## Applications of Cluster Analysis

Cluster analysis has multiple applications across various fields, such as:

- **Marketing**: Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.
- **Data Science**: Grouping unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns.
- **Biology**: Classification of species based on shared characteristics.
- **Finance**: Grouping financial assets for risk analysis.

## Final Thoughts

Cluster analysis is an invaluable technique for data segmentation, allowing researchers and analysts to identify patterns and groups of similar elements within complex datasets. With its origins in biology, this technique has evolved and expanded into a wide variety of fields, proving to be a flexible and powerful tool for statistical analysis.
