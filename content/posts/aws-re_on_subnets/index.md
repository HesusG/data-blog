# Breaking Down AWS Subnets: Public vs. Private

Subnets are the backbone of any AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). They allow you to logically separate resources within your VPC, manage traffic, and control access to ensure your architecture is both secure and scalable. But what exactly are subnets, and how do they fit into the bigger picture?

This blog will explain subnets in detail, covering everything from their purpose to how they work in AWS. Whether you're setting up a web application or managing enterprise workloads, understanding subnets is critical to building a robust cloud environment.

## **What is a Subnet?**

A **subnet** (short for subnetwork) is a logical division of your VPC's IP address range. It allows you to organize resources and control how traffic flows within your network. Every subnet belongs to a single **Availability Zone (AZ)** in AWS, ensuring redundancy and high availability.

### **Why Are Subnets Important?**

- **Logical Separation**: Organize resources by function, such as web servers, databases, or application servers.
- **Traffic Control**: Define which resources are accessible from the internet and which are not.
- **Scalability**: Use subnets to manage and distribute workloads across multiple AZs.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduce unnecessary public internet exposure, minimizing data transfer costs.

## **Subnet Basics**

### **1. CIDR Blocks and Subnets**

A **CIDR block** (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) defines the range of IP addresses for your subnet. When you create a VPC, you assign it a CIDR block (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`), which provides a pool of IP addresses. Subnets further divide this pool into smaller segments.

#### **Example of CIDR Allocation**
- **VPC CIDR Block**: `10.0.0.0/16` (65,536 IPs)
- **Public Subnet CIDR**: `10.0.0.0/24` (256 IPs)
- **Private Subnet CIDR**: `10.0.1.0/24` (256 IPs)

Each subnet inherits the CIDR block of the VPC but uses a smaller portion of its IP range.

### **2. Public vs. Private Subnets**

In AWS, subnets can be classified as **public** or **private** based on their accessibility.

#### **Public Subnets**
- A **public subnet** is directly accessible from the internet.
- It must have:
  - A **route table** with a route to the **Internet Gateway (IGW)**.
  - Resources (e.g., EC2 instances) with a **public IP address**.

##### **Use Cases for Public Subnets**:
1. Hosting web servers or APIs that need to be publicly accessible.
2. Load balancers handling internet-facing traffic.
3. NAT Gateways for enabling private subnets to access the internet securely.

---

#### **Private Subnets**
- A **private subnet** is not directly accessible from the internet.
- Traffic can only flow through:
  - A **NAT Gateway** in a public subnet (for internet-bound traffic).
  - VPC Peering or a VPN connection (for private communication).

##### **Use Cases for Private Subnets**:
1. Hosting databases, application servers, or back-end systems.
2. Running sensitive workloads requiring isolation.
3. Connecting on-premises environments via AWS Direct Connect.

### **3. Subnet Characteristics**

| **Feature**                | **Public Subnet**                          | **Private Subnet**                       |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Route to Internet**       | Yes (via Internet Gateway)                | No (unless using a NAT Gateway)          |
| **Public IP Assignment**    | Automatically assigned (if enabled)       | Not assigned                             |
| **Accessibility**           | Open to public traffic (if configured)    | Isolated, accessible only via private links |
| **Common Use**              | Web servers, NAT Gateways                 | Databases, internal applications         |

## **How Subnets Work in Practice**

### **Scenario: A Two-Tier Web Application**
Let’s build a simple web application with the following requirements:
1. A **public-facing web server** to serve requests.
2. A **database** that stores sensitive user data, isolated from public access.

#### **1. VPC Setup**
- CIDR Block: `10.0.0.0/16`

#### **2. Subnet Configuration**
- Public Subnet:
  - CIDR Block: `10.0.0.0/24`
  - Route Table: Points to the Internet Gateway.
- Private Subnet:
  - CIDR Block: `10.0.1.0/24`
  - Route Table: Points to a NAT Gateway in the public subnet.

#### **3. Resource Placement**
- **Web Server (EC2 Instance)**:
  - Placed in the public subnet.
  - Assigned a public IP for internet access.
- **Database (RDS Instance)**:
  - Placed in the private subnet.
  - No public IP to ensure isolation.

#### **Traffic Flow**
- Users access the web server via its public IP.
- The web server communicates with the database privately within the VPC.

## **Step-by-Step Guide: Creating Subnets in AWS**

### **Step 1: Create a VPC**
1. Go to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the **VPC Dashboard** and choose **Create VPC**.
3. Assign a CIDR block (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).

---

### **Step 2: Create Subnets**
1. In the VPC Dashboard, select **Subnets** > **Create Subnet**.
2. Create the **public subnet**:
   - Name: `Public Subnet 1`
   - CIDR: `10.0.0.0/24`
   - Availability Zone: Select one (e.g., `us-west-2a`).
3. Create the **private subnet**:
   - Name: `Private Subnet 1`
   - CIDR: `10.0.1.0/24`
   - Availability Zone: Same as the public subnet.

---

### **Step 3: Associate Route Tables**
1. Go to the **Route Tables** section.
2. Attach the **public route table** to the public subnet:
   - Add a route to the Internet Gateway (`0.0.0.0/0`).
3. Attach the **private route table** to the private subnet:
   - Add a route to the NAT Gateway.

---

### **Step 4: Launch Resources**
1. Launch an EC2 instance in the public subnet:
   - Assign a public IP.
   - Attach a security group to allow HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22).
2. Launch an RDS instance in the private subnet:
   - Ensure it has no public IP.
   - Use security groups to allow only the web server to access the database.

---

## **Common Challenges with Subnets**

1. **Internet Access Not Working in Public Subnet**:
   - Ensure the subnet’s route table has a route to the Internet Gateway.
   - Confirm that the EC2 instance has a public IP.

2. **Private Subnet Resources Can’t Access the Internet**:
   - Check the NAT Gateway configuration.
   - Verify the private route table includes a route to the NAT Gateway.

3. **IP Address Exhaustion**:
   - Plan CIDR block allocation carefully to avoid running out of IPs.

---

## **Key Takeaways**

- Subnets are essential for organizing and securing resources within a VPC.
- Public subnets are accessible from the internet, while private subnets are isolated for internal use.
- Route tables, Internet Gateways, and NAT Gateways define how traffic flows between subnets and the outside world.

Understanding subnets is a critical step in building secure and scalable cloud architectures. In the next blog, we’ll explore **route tables** in detail and learn how they guide traffic within and outside your VPC.
