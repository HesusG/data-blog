# Reflections on Teaching and Tech

    As I dive into my master's in pedagogy, I want to share insights about how teaching and technology intersect in the classroom and beyond. Drawing from my own experiences in tech education, letâ€™s explore the evolving role of educators in fostering critical thinking and curiosity.

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m currently studying online at Universidad Popular AutÃ³noma del Estado de Puebla, working on my master's degree in pedagogy. This weekâ€™s reading for my academic writing course focused on synthesizing some of Noam Chomskyâ€™s ideas. Itâ€™s making me rethink a lot about the way we teach, especially when it comes to fostering independent thinking.

In tech education, Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the practical sideâ€”teaching people how to code, analyze data, or use cloud technologies. But now Iâ€™m digging into the *why* and *how* of teaching itself. How do we, as educators, ensure that weâ€™re not just training people to follow instructions, but actually encouraging them to think critically and creatively?

## Encouraging Critical Thinking in Tech

One of the most thought-provoking points Iâ€™ve been reflecting on is Chomsky's argument that education often serves as a form of indoctrination, where students are trained to obey rather than think critically. In tech, we often give students specific problems to solve but rarely give them the freedom to question the process or think beyond whatâ€™s presented. 

In my experience, real learning happens when students are allowed to make mistakes and discover things for themselves. For instance, in data analysis or SQL training, I now encourage students to struggle with problems, because the solutions they discover on their own tend to stick with them longer. This approach not only strengthens their understanding but also fosters independence.

## Applying Pedagogical Theory in the Classroom

Chomsky critiques traditional education systems, where students are often marched through a rigid curriculum focused on memorization. Reflecting on this, Iâ€™ve started to think about ways to shift from this approach. One key concept is **scaffolding**â€”providing students with just enough support to get started, then gradually removing that support as they become more confident. This aligns with the idea that students must develop their own motivations for learning.

Additionally, project-based learning is crucial. In tech, projects give students the freedom to explore topics that interest them, turning their learning into a creative process rather than a mechanical one.

## Recommendations for Further Reading

If you're interested in these ideas, I highly recommend exploring Chomsky's critiques on education. These readings have challenged my own approach to teaching, reminding me that while technical skills are important, fostering independent thought is equally critical.

While I havenâ€™t been able to read each book or article in full, Iâ€™ve explored key excerpts and tried to absorb as much as possible from these valuable resources. These texts have challenged me to rethink traditional approaches to education, and Iâ€™ve attempted to piece together meaningful insights based on the content Iâ€™ve engaged with.
