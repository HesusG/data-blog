# Mastering Graph Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, and Kruskal’s

Graphs are one of the most versatile data structures in computer science, representing everything from social networks to road maps. Understanding graph algorithms like **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, **Dijkstra’s**, and **Kruskal’s** is crucial for solving complex problems. In this post, we’ll explore these algorithms, their Python implementations, and real-world applications.

## **What is a Graph?**

A graph is a collection of **nodes (vertices)** connected by **edges**. Graphs can be:
- **Directed or Undirected**: Whether edges have a direction.
- **Weighted or Unweighted**: Whether edges have weights (costs).

### **Graph Representations**
1. **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array where `matrix[i][j]` is 1 if there is an edge from node `i` to `j`.
2. **Adjacency List**: A list where each node stores its neighbors.

## **1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

### **What is BFS?**
BFS explores all nodes at the current depth level before moving to the next level. It’s often used to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) (vertices + edges).
- **Use Cases**: Shortest path in unweighted graphs, level-order traversal in trees.

### **Python Implementation**
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    visited.add(start)
    result = []

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        result.append(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return result

# Test Graph
graph = {
    0: [1, 2],
    1: [0, 3, 4],
    2: [0, 4],
    3: [1],
    4: [1, 2]
}
print("BFS:", bfs(graph, 0))  # Output: BFS: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## **2. Depth-First Search (DFS)**

### **What is DFS?**
DFS explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. It can be implemented using recursion or a stack.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E).
- **Use Cases**: Cycle detection, topological sorting, connected components.

### **Python Implementation**
```python
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    result = [start]

    for neighbor in graph[start]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            result.extend(dfs(graph, neighbor, visited))
    return result

# Test Graph
print("DFS:", dfs(graph, 0))  # Output: DFS: [0, 1, 3, 4, 2]
```

## **3. Dijkstra’s Algorithm**

### **What is Dijkstra’s Algorithm?**
Dijkstra’s algorithm finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Time Complexity**: O((V + E) * log(V)) using a priority queue.
- **Use Cases**: Shortest path in road networks, routing.

### **Python Implementation**
```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    min_heap = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0

    while min_heap:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(min_heap)

        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node]:
            distance = current_distance + weight
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (distance, neighbor))
    return distances

# Test Graph
weighted_graph = {
    0: [(1, 1), (2, 4)],
    1: [(2, 2), (3, 6)],
    2: [(3, 3)],
    3: []
}
print("Dijkstra:", dijkstra(weighted_graph, 0))  # Output: Dijkstra: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 6}
```

## **4. Kruskal’s Algorithm**

### **What is Kruskal’s Algorithm?**
Kruskal’s algorithm finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph, connecting all vertices with the minimum total edge weight.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Time Complexity**: O(E * log(E)) due to sorting edges.
- **Use Cases**: Network design, clustering.

### **Python Implementation**
```python
def kruskal(edges, num_nodes):
    edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])  # Sort edges by weight
    parent = list(range(num_nodes))
    rank = [0] * num_nodes

    def find(node):
        if parent[node] != node:
            parent[node] = find(parent[node])  # Path compression
        return parent[node]

    def union(node1, node2):
        root1, root2 = find(node1), find(node2)
        if root1 != root2:
            if rank[root1] > rank[root2]:
                parent[root2] = root1
            elif rank[root1] < rank[root2]:
                parent[root1] = root2
            else:
                parent[root2] = root1
                rank[root1] += 1

    mst = []
    for node1, node2, weight in edges:
        if find(node1) != find(node2):
            union(node1, node2)
            mst.append((node1, node2, weight))
    return mst

# Test Edges
edges = [(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2), (0, 2, 4), (1, 3, 6), (2, 3, 3)]
print("Kruskal's MST:", kruskal(edges, 4))  # Output: Kruskal's MST: [(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2), (2, 3, 3)]
```
