# My Journey into AWS: Starting from Scratch

> After working somewhat comfortably with GCP and Azureâ€”primarily to consume APIs, manage basic admin portals, and handle simple monitoringâ€”diving into Amazon Web Services (AWS) felt like stepping into a much larger ecosystem. Enrolling in the **AWS re/Start** program, a training initiative designed to provide foundational cloud knowledge, is helping me understand AWS from the ground up.

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™ve spent some time with other cloud platforms before, but mainly at a mid-level capacityâ€”nothing too deep, just enough to navigate their consoles and integrate external APIs. AWS, however, is a different story. Its depth, breadth of services, and global infrastructure are both impressive and a bit intimidating. Yet, the AWS re/Start program has made this learning curve more approachable by offering a clear, hands-on path into the fundamentals.

## Discovering AWS Fundamentals

As a beginner in AWS, I started exploring the official documentation to get familiar with core concepts. The AWS Documentation ([https://docs.aws.amazon.com/](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/)) is a treasure trove of information. I found the overviews and introductory guides on services like **Amazon EC2** (for compute), **Amazon S3** (for storage), and **Amazon RDS** (for managed databases) particularly helpful. What stands out is how well-structured these resources are. They not only explain what each service does, but also guide you through common use cases and best practices.

Meanwhile, AWS re/Start itself provides a structured learning environment. Through guided labs, Iâ€™ve been setting up virtual machines (EC2 instances), playing with IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies to understand permissions, and exploring how different services interact. The program encourages hands-on practice, which Iâ€™ve found essential for really grasping the core concepts.

## Building Confidence Through Practice

Where I once felt uncertain about how to navigate AWSâ€™s Management Console, Iâ€™m now more comfortable experimenting. Iâ€™ve learned to trust the official AWS resourcesâ€”like the **AWS Getting Started Resource Center** ([https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/))â€”to guide me. These materials offer step-by-step tutorials, which help reinforce knowledge through real-world scenarios. For instance, creating a simple web application using an EC2 instance or setting up a static website on S3 has given me the confidence that I can actually build something functional in AWS.

Another invaluable resource has been the **AWS Well-Architected Framework** ([https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)). Although itâ€™s more advanced than what a beginner might typically dive into, browsing through it has given me insight into the guiding principles behind robust, secure, and scalable cloud architectures. This perspective helps me understand not just how to do something in AWS, but why certain best practices exist.

## Reflecting on the Experience

Transitioning from having a moderate understanding of GCP and Azure to starting from scratch with AWS has been both humbling and empowering. On one hand, itâ€™s a reminder that every cloud platform has its unique paradigms and architectural choices. On the other, itâ€™s exciting to realize how quickly I can ramp up my AWS skills by leveraging official training programs and documentation.

As I continue through AWS re/Start, my understanding of cloud fundamentals deepens. Iâ€™m learning to appreciate IAM roles and policies, network configurations, and how services like AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch integrate for governance, compliance, and monitoring. What seemed like a vast, complex ecosystem is gradually becoming a well-organized toolbox for building and deploying solutions.

## Recommended Official AWS Resources

For anyone else starting out, here are some official AWS resources that have guided me:

- **AWS re/Start Program**: [https://aws.amazon.com/training/restart/](https://aws.amazon.com/training/restart/)  
  A free, full-time, skills-development program that prepares learners for entry-level cloud positions.

- **AWS Documentation**: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/)  
  The primary reference point for learning about AWS services, with tutorials and sample projects.

- **AWS Getting Started Resource Center**: [https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/)  
  Ideal for hands-on labs and guided tours for beginners.

- **AWS Well-Architected Framework**: [https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)  
  Useful for understanding the principles behind designing and operating reliable, secure, and cost-effective systems on AWS.

This journey is just beginning, but so far, AWS re/Start and the official AWS resources have helped me develop skills that were once completely unfamiliar to me. Iâ€™m excited to continue exploring new services and applying this knowledge to real-world projects, gradually becoming proficient in an environment that once felt overwhelming.
