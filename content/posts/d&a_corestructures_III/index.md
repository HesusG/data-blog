# Mastering Core Data Structures: Hash Tables, Trees, Graphs, and Tries

Core data structures like **hash tables**, **trees**, **graphs**, and **tries** are essential tools for solving complex programming problems efficiently. In this post, we’ll break down their key concepts, use cases, and Python implementations.

---

## **1. Hash Tables**

### **What is a Hash Table?**
A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. It provides fast access, insertion, and deletion operations.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Average Time Complexity**: O(1) for lookup, insert, and delete.
- **Worst-Case Time Complexity**: O(n) (in case of hash collisions).

### **Use Cases**
- Caching (e.g., storing recently used data).
- Implementing dictionaries.
- Counting frequencies in datasets.

### **Python Implementation**
```python
# Example: Counting word frequencies
def word_count(words):
    freq = {}
    for word in words:
        freq[word] = freq.get(word, 0) + 1
    return freq

# Test
words = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple"]
print("Word Count:", word_count(words))  # Output: {'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1}
```

## **2. Trees**

### **What is a Tree?**
A tree is a hierarchical data structure with a root node and child nodes. Each node can have multiple children, but only one parent.

### **Key Variants**
- **Binary Trees**: Each node has at most two children.
- **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**: Left child < Parent < Right child.
- **AVL Trees**: A self-balancing BST.
- **Segment Trees**: Used for range queries and updates.

### **Use Cases**
- Representing hierarchical data (e.g., file systems).
- Searching and sorting.
- Efficient range queries.

### **Python Implementation: Binary Search Tree**
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def insert(root, key):
    if root is None:
        return TreeNode(key)
    if key < root.key:
        root.left = insert(root.left, key)
    else:
        root.right = insert(root.right, key)
    return root

def inorder_traversal(root):
    if root:
        inorder_traversal(root.left)
        print(root.key, end=" ")
        inorder_traversal(root.right)

# Test
root = None
for key in [10, 5, 20, 3, 7]:
    root = insert(root, key)
print("Inorder Traversal:", end=" ")
inorder_traversal(root)  # Output: 3 5 7 10 20
```

## **3. Graphs**

### **What is a Graph?**
A graph consists of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them. It is used to represent relationships.

### **Key Types**
- **Directed vs. Undirected Graphs**: Edges have or don’t have direction.
- **Weighted vs. Unweighted Graphs**: Edges have or don’t have weights.

### **Use Cases**
- Social networks (e.g., friend recommendations).
- Navigation systems (e.g., shortest path in maps).
- Task scheduling.

### **Python Implementation: Adjacency List Representation**
```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = {}

    def add_edge(self, u, v):
        if u not in self.graph:
            self.graph[u] = []
        self.graph[u].append(v)

    def print_graph(self):
        for node in self.graph:
            print(f"{node} -> {self.graph[node]}")

# Test
g = Graph()
g.add_edge(0, 1)
g.add_edge(0, 2)
g.add_edge(1, 2)
g.add_edge(2, 0)
g.add_edge(2, 3)
g.print_graph()
```

## **4. Tries**

### **What is a Trie?**
A trie (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure used for storing strings, where each node represents a character.

### **Key Characteristics**
- Efficient for prefix-based searches.
- Space-intensive for large datasets.

### **Use Cases**
- Autocomplete systems.
- Spell-checkers.
- Prefix-based searches.

### **Python Implementation**
```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_end_of_word = True

    def search(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return node.is_end_of_word

# Test
trie = Trie()
trie.insert("hello")
trie.insert("world")
print("Search 'hello':", trie.search("hello"))  # Output: True
print("Search 'python':", trie.search("python"))  # Output: False
```
